# My Current Github Website

I try not to be too descriptive about the contents of this repo, because it's my own main website hosted through GitHub, so it's going to be changing and growing a lot as I gain new skills and decide that I want different code to be on here.

I'm considering another complete redesign soon, and that website is currently on another repo, waiting to be moved here...
