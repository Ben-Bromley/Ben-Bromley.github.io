      <h3>On-Stage Performance</h3>
      <!--Joseph-->
      <article>
        <h4 class="Article-Title">Joseph and the Technicolour Dreamcoat</h4>
        <p class="Article-About">Lead Role | SWHS: February 2019</p>
        <p class="Article-Content">My first time acting, singing and dancing
        on-stage. The oppurtunity to play this role was quite a surprise to me,
        having never sang and acted on stage before. I went to the main
        auditions and quickly got a call back, got asked to audition for the
        role and was given it! (At this point it's note worthy that the director
        who cast me is a well established director in the Leicestershire
        performing arts community). I quickly learnt my lines and songs. The
        role involved choreographing some scenes myself with fellow cast
        members. I very much enjoyed playing the part, rehearsing, and helping
        our brilliant phaoroh learn his lines as he stepped in last minute.
        We had an audience of approximately 400, 200 per night.</p>

        <h4 class="Article-Title">Aladdin Pantomime</h4>
        <p class="Article-About">Evil Sidekick |
          Church of Jesus Christ December</p>
        <p class="Article-Content">I was scouted for this role after being seen
        Joseph, and I loved every minute. It was a big step up in
        proffessionalism which was a relief. We had 2 showings in the same day,
        with a total of 800 audience members. It was the 3rd instance of the
        churches christmas panto, and as per usual, it was a huge success, among
        all. The show was also a charity event, and generated a very large
        amount of canned food donations from audience members.</p>

      <h3>Off-Stage Performance</h3>
        <!--FAME!-->
        <article>
        <h4 class="Article-Title">FAME! The Musical</h4>
        <p class="Article-About">Rhythmn Guitarist | SWHS: February 2018</p>
        <p class="Article-Content">This show was my debut in musical theatre,
        and despite being a high school show, the band had an impressive
        quality. I was responsible for managing my own levels and tone, which
        I did successfully. Desipte being new to playing guitar from sheet
        music, I learnt very quickly and loved every second of the 4 months of
        rehearsal and performance.</p>

      <!--SisterAct-->
      <article>
        <h4 class="Article-Title">Sister Act Production</h4>
        <p class="Article-About">Piano | Wigston College: March 2020</p>
        <p class="Article-Content">My first time playing piano in a large
          production, I went from struggling with the first note, to sight-
          reading the entire 2nd Act. We performed the full show 4 times, with
          200+ audience members each night. We were held to a proffessional
          standard. It was an amazing experience, and the ensemble sounded
          incredible.</p>

      <article>
        <h4 class="Article-Title">Technical Theatre, Health and Safety,
          Stage Design, and Stage Setup</h4>
        <p class="Article-About">Various gear and equipment | SWHS: 2017-2019</p>
        <p class="Article-Content">I spent hours upon hours working with the
          set, gear, and tech at SWHS. I rountinely tested the sound and
          lighting equipment, set up the gear on the staging for almost
          every show for 3 years (whilst also performing in most of them).
          when I wasn't setting up or on stage, I was in the tech booth,
          alternating between doing live sound, and live lighting. <br>
          Not a single other student knew that system as well as I did, which
          benefited me greatly, the gear was always at my disposal, I could
          get the setup show-ready incredibly quickly, and my extended knowledge
          of the jester lighting console gave me a wider range of uses that
          significanly increased performance quality. This, as well as being
          closely involved with the organisation of the shows earned me the
          unique contribution to the school award.</p>

        December 2018</p>
        <p class="Article-Content">This was the 2nd iteration of the Churches
        christmas panto (as mentioned earlier) and its part of how I started in
        the church panto. It involved the creative use of colour and dynamics
        to create the best atmosphere possible for the audience. It was a
        role I treated very seriously. I was also privelleged to work with
        2 very experienced and professional sound engineers.</p>

          2019-Present Day</p>
        <p class="Article-Content">After watching this choir perform for years
        I finally decided it was my turn to join. I started with experience
        in singing bass, but never tenor. However, through the help of those
        around me as well as my knowledge of music theory and ear training, I
        quickly learnt my parts and my ability to sight sing tenor parts is ever
        increasing.</p>

        <p class="Article-Content">After a few years of bass sight-singing
        experience with Church, I was able to adapt those skills when I joined
        our colleges A Capella group. So far we've done 2 pentatonix covers,
        Shallow, and Say Something. These songs have allowed me to develop my
        sight singing ability, and introduced me to new musical passages,
        such as arpeggio runs.</p>

          during my recital for BTEC Music, which incorporated our entire class
          performing at least 2 pieces, contrasting from one another. Most
          people just met this criteria. Whilst most people played between 2
          and 4I went above and beyond, and in our show with a setlist of 24
          songs, I played 12 of them. 2 Solos, 2 Duets, 4 band pieces, and
