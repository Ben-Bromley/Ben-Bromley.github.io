    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>A Little Intro</h2>
    <p class="maintext">Born in Leicester, raised in Leicester,
    hoping not to die in Leicester. I've loved music since
    playing keyboard at age 8, all the way to the church organs
    and concert grands I play now.
    Along the way I've picked up few extras of course,
    some strings here, some brass there, but
    I won't spoil my <a class="MainTextEmbed" href="">experience</a>
    page for you. Recently I've gained an interest in web development, hence
    this poorly coded project of mine. It's taken up plenty of my evenings,
    but every second was worth it.
    </p>
    <h2>Where I'm based</h2>
    <p class="maintext">As I mentioned before I'm Leicester based. So for the
    crazy few of you who don't know where that is, have a little look at the
    map below: </p>

    <h2>Where I study</h2>
    <p class="maintext">Currently I'm an upper 6th form student of Wigston
      College! Here I study Music, Music Technology, and Computer Science.
      And when I'm not studying, I'm either chilling, or performing! </p>
